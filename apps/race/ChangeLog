0.67: Initial version
0.68: Set GPS to output all NMEA messages on kill. App only outputs GGA messages. Turned on SBAS satellites; this is a test. Should improve position accuracy if corrections are available.
0.69: modified to use SBAS satellites No. 1-19, corresponding to PRN 120-138, instead of just 1-16. Turn off SBAS satellites on kill. 
0.70: changed GPS power-on code; GPS not on would have caused the start screen to not display correctly
0.71: revert to issuing command to use SBAS satellites 1-16 instead of satellites 1-19
0.72: added mode to turn SBAS satellite use on/off
0.73: fixed timer clearing function
